What I did this summer: Duncan Klemm
I worked 40+ hrs/week at Lowe's to make as much money for the school year as I could. Additionally, I applied to internship after internship, but evidently I am unhireable.
All good though. the search process allowed me to hone in on what exactly I am looking for in terms of a job and location and stuff.
